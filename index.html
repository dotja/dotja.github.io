    <kbd>With</kbd> DevOps being more common these days, programmers with systems knowledge have more leverage. In this article we will take a closer look at sockets and ports.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    A socket enables 2 processes to communicate with each other. Communication can be in the form of sending a message, sending a file, a request over a network or other.<br />
    When 2 processes are on the same host they can establish channel-like communication. A socket (termed Unix socket in this case) is first created then it is bound to a file (named or unnamed) on the host's filesystem in which both processes have access to.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    If the 2 processes are on different machines, each process needs to identify itself by providing the IP address of the machine it is running on in addition to the port number where the process is reserved to run. An Internet socket, in this case, has the job of locating applications on the Internet thereby requiring the support of protocols such as TCP. On an IP address and port number combination, a server would be listening for incoming messages from several clients each having their own sockets.
    The port - which is part of the Internet socket, helps redirect the packets arriving at the machine to the right application.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    When creating a socket, you need to specify 2 arguments.
    The first is domain, which describes the purpose of the socket. For example, AF_UNIX is used when the 2 processes are bound to the same machine. In case processes are on different machines, AF_INET is used. AF_VSOCK is another example and it is used to allow communication between virtual machines and their hosts.<br />
    The second argument is type and it describes the logic in which the data between the processes is transferred. Here we will consider SOCK_STREAM which is a 2-way reliable transmission. The type of the socket can have several protocols associated with it and 1 protocol may be chosen.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    Creating and running a socket involves system calls. System calls are executed in the Kernel on behalf of the user. The Python code below makes use of these system calls under the hood.
    For a server/client scenario, let's see what the code looks like in Python.
    </p>

    </div>

<pre>
<code>
## server code
import socket as s
def server():
    ## create the server socket
    ss = s.socket(s.AF_INET, s.SOCK_STREAM)
    server_addr = ('localhost', 12345)
    try:
        ## bind the socket to an IP and port
        ss.bind(server_addr)
        ## start listening on that socket
        ss.listen(1)
        ## accept incoming requests
        conxn, addr = ss.accept()
        print("Accepted connection from: " + str(addr))
        while True:
            ## receive data from the client
            data = conxn.recv(1024).decode()
            if data:
                print("This is what the client sent: " + str(data))
    except:
        conxn.close()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    server()

</pre>

## client code
import socket as s
class client:
    def __init__(self):
        ## create the client socket
        self.cs = s.socket(s.AF_INET, s.SOCK_STREAM)
        server_addr = ('localhost', 12345)
        ## connect to the running server we created
        self.cs.connect(server_addr)
        self.msg_elems = []
    def send_msg(self):
    """ A method to send user input to the server """

    <kbd>For</kbd> a new device to interact with your computer it needs the help of a driver. The driver is a software that can act as an interface between the new device and your computer. 
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    Drivers for commonly used devices such as a mouse usually come with the operating system.
    When you buy a new graphical tablet for instance, the first thing you usually do before using it is install the device driver which you can download online from the manufacturer's website. This allows the graphical tablet to communicate and interact with your operating system.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    A networking device or a network adapter such as wireless cards or ethernet cards are used to allow the computer to connect to the internet. A network driver in this case is needed to handle the data received from the internet using an internet protocol.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    When you install Docker, you get a client and a daemon. You use Docker commands such as run and build to interact with the client which in turn communicates with the daemon that does the heavy work.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    The Docker daemon creates docker0 which is a virtual network interface described as the bridge network that has a bridge driver. It randomly chooses an avialable IP address and assigns it to docker0.
    </p>

    </div>

<pre>
<code>
## on your host
## view the docker networks
docker network ls

## view docker0
ifconfig docker0

## you can inspect the bridge network and view the connected containers
docker network inspect bridge
</code>
</pre>

    <div class="blog_content_style container">
    <p id="blog_text">
    If a network is not specified, containers by default join the bridge network and are able to communicate with each others.
    </p>
    </div>

    <br />

<pre>
<code>
## running a container
docker run -d --name my_container my_image_id

## is equivalent to
docker run -d --net=bridge --name my_container my_image_id
</code>
</pre>

    <div class="blog_content_style container">
    <p id="blog_text">
    When running 2 containers, exec into 1 and ping the other container to check that they are able to communicate.
    </p>
    </div>

<pre>
<code>
## You can view the IP address using
hostname -I

## or
ifconfig

## inside the container install ifconfig
sudo apt install net-tools

## inside the container install ping
sudo apt install iputils-ping

## after finding the IP addresses
## inside container 1
ping container2_ip
</code>
</pre>

    <div class="blog_content_style container">
    <p id="blog_text">
    By default, traffic from the container is NOT forwarded to the outside host. Therefore the ports of the container where an app is running must be published against the host's ports.
    </p>
    <p id="blog_text">
    Users are able to create their own network but many times you would want to configure the default bridge network instead. You can simply specify your settings such as IP address and netmask of docker0 in /etc/docker/daemon.json which gets read by docker on installation or restart.
